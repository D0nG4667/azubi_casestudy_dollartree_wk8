#### Binary classification
In this case study, we will find a data set on the sales of items on
the Dollar Tree Website. The task is to train one(1) classification
algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent,
Na√Øve Bayes etc.) to predict the gender (Male or Female) of the
customer based on the other features.
This is a binary classification problem.
Some columns were dropped that were not important for this
training. This will be justified in this during your
presentation.
#### Important
The focus of the project is on the data preparation, modeling, and
evaluation phase of the CRISP-DM. This means you should focus
more of your energy on these phases.
